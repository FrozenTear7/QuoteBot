# QuoteBot
A simple discord bot, which reads the messages and waits for the format **"quote" ~author**.

If such a message is sent, the bot saves it to the database, which later allows users to read the author's random quotes,
by writing **!quote author**.
The messages are connected to the server from which they were sent.
