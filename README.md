The quotes are connected to the server from which they were read.

* !quote **author** / !q **author** - returns a random quote from the author and the server the command is written from
* !authors / !a - returns all authors, that have quotes on the server
* !all **author** - returns all quotes from that author
* !aliases **author** - returns author's aliases, where **author** is any of the author's aliases
* !dq **quoteId** - deletes the quote
* !da **authorId** - deletes the author and author's quotes
