# QuoteBot
A simple discord bot, which checks all the messages from the server, that it's in and stores quotes written in format: "**quote**" ~**author**.
The quotes are connected to the server from which they were read.

## Options

* !quote **author** / !q **author** - returns a random quote from the author and the server the command is written from
* !authors / !a - returns all authors, that have quotes on the server
* !all **author** - returns all quotes from that author
